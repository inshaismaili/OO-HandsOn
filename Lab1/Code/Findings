There are three classes:
AccManager1,AccManager2and Account.
AccManager1 and AccManager2 both has two methods within it ie..fillAccountData and displayAccountData.
The class Account takes the input for both these classes
We can clearly see that the AccNo declared in Account class has some format(string assinged with the prefix value which is concatenated with accno).
when we run the program we see that the values that's assigned to the AccNo in the accMnager1 class has the missing prefix.Thats wrong.

when we see the balance variable  also ,In the Account class the balance is calculated with some interest added to it,the same thing is retrieved by the
AccManager2 class through getbalance() method but for the AccManager1 class the balance is simply assigned without any interest added to it,thats wrong.

Therefore there is no problem with the class AccountManager2,that's working fine.
