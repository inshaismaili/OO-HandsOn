The AccManager class had not implemented the fillAccountData(Account a1) method,thus when we were running the code, we were getting null values.
The method fillAccountData(Account a1) has  been implemented and is now taking the values thats been assigned in the  displayAccountData(Account a1).
Thus it now displays the values as entered.
